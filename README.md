# Student Management System

The Student Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline various processes for university students. This system facilitates functions such as registration, personal details amendments, student ID card issuance requests, withdrawal processes, and campus credit balance top-ups.

## User Interface

The user interface serves as the primary gateway for both students and university staff members. Upon launching the system, users are greeted with an intuitive and user-friendly menu that guides them to their respective sections.

## User Authentication

To access the system's functionalities, users must complete a secure login process using their unique credentials. For demonstration purposes, the system has been preloaded with 5 test student accounts and 5 test staff member accounts.

## Student Functionalities

If the user is a student, they will have access to the following options:

1. **Register at the University**: Students can initiate the registration process by providing the necessary information.
2. **Amend Details**: Students can update their personal information as needed.
3. **Request ID Card Issuance**: Students can request the issuance of a student ID card.
4. **Withdrawal**: Students can initiate the withdrawal process.
5. **Top Up Campus Credit**: Students can add funds to their campus credit balance.

## Staff Member Verification

For each option selected by a student, staff member verification is required. This verification process entails sending a request to a staff member, who can either accept or decline the student's request.

## Database Updates

After a staff member accepts or declines a student's request, the system will update the database accordingly to reflect the decision. This ensures that the database is always current and accurately represents the status of student requests.
